# AmpliaPhpClient
This library contains classes that encapsulate the calls to Amplia service 
(X.509 certificate issuing solution) for PHP applications.

The recommend way to install **Amplia Client Lib** is through 
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

    "require": {
        "lacuna/amplia-client": "^1.0.2"
    }
    
This library depends on the GuzzleHttp package, which in turn requires PHP 5.5 or
greater.
